// This file previously contained a Firebase Cloud Function webhook implementation.
// Migration note: webhook functionality has been moved to `src/app/api/webhook/route.ts` which now writes to Supabase using the SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY.
// If you want server-side functions, create Supabase Edge Functions or Vercel serverless functions and use the Supabase client.
